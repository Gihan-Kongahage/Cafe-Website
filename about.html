            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Space Café way founded in <em>2019</em> by two university students who never
            imagined that
            simple joke would turn into something real. What began as a casual conversation over coffee slowly
            became a place of it's own. <strong>And the rest of the story best told in person 😉...</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Space Café is more than just a coffee shop. It's a quiet corner of readers, thinkers, and anyone
            curious about the universe. Our space themed atmosphere is paired with shelves of books ranging from
            classic literature to science, philosophy, and astronomy.

            Sins opening our doors, we've proudly employed dozens of collage students who wer looking for their
            first opportunity.<strong>We believe good coffee tastes even better when it supports a
                community.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're looking for a freshly brewed cup of coffee, a homemade pastry, and a place where curiosity
            feels at home, stop by our corner of the city.
